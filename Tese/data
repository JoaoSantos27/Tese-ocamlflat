sequential transducer

A transducer is synchronous if for each edge, the input label and the output label are letters.
A transducer is literal if for each edge the input label and the output label are letters or the empty word. (Todos os nossos são literais por definição).

http://www.jandaciuk.pl/thesis/node13.html  *** EXEMPLO ***
Transducers can be seen as automata with transitions labeled with symbols from ￼,
The state transition function d maps 
The emission function maps
A transducer is said to be deterministic iff both the transition function d and the emission function ￼ lead to sets containing at most one element.
Traditionally, such deterministic transducers are called subsequential. For subsequential transducers, the transducing function can be computed by deterministically following a single path in the transducer.

Classical literature on string-to-string transductions largely focusses on finitestate transducers that realize rational relations [13].
The expressive power of finite transducers is limited. For example, they can implement transductions such as inserting a symbol in
an input string and deleting a substring of the input string, but they cannot implement transductions such as reversing an input string or the swapping two
substrings within an input string.

Determinization of Transducers
It is not always possible to construct such a deterministic (subsequential) transducer. Example.
